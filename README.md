# 🏦 Bank Management System (C++)
## 📖 About the Project

This project is a console-based Bank Management System developed using C++. It is part of the Abu-Hadhoud Platform training track with Dr. Muhammed Abu Hadhoud.
It simulates basic banking operations such as managing client accounts, performing transactions, and storing data persistently using files.

#### The system allows users to interact through a menu-driven interface to:
Manage client records
Perform deposits and withdrawals
View total balances
Store and retrieve data from a file

#### This project is designed to strengthen understanding of core C++ concepts, file handling, and structured programming.
